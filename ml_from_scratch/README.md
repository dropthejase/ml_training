# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch #
My attempt at implementing core ML algorithms from scratch to better understand them!

### Supervised ML ###
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* KNN
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Trees
* Perceptron
* Simple Linear SVM

### Unsupervised ML ###
* Hard KMeans
* PCA

### Neural Networks ###
* Simple Feedforward ANN with 1 Hidden Layer
